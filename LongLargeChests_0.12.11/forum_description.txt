I have always wanted to build a factory without using (much) transport belts, but that requires large (dimension-wise, not storage-wise) chests that can reserve its slots for various types of items.

Searching the forum does not result in any hits, so I decided to roll one myself.
Version 0.11.5 works in multiplayer mode.
Version 0.12.6 works in Factorio 0.12.0.

Enjoy! And let me know if it works/doesn't work for you.
Long.

This is how I envision a module-factory would look (except that the large 5x5 chest would be fed directly from the train and not by requester chests.)

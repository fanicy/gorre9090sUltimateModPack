rail-switch-lamp = Place it on rail and connect to circuit network
rail-signal-detector = Place it near to rail signal and it will output 1 if red and 0 if green
rail-station-controller = Set destenation station name in gui and set circuit condition, if condition is reached controller will send train to destination
rail-train-detector = Outputs 1 to all signals when train is near
rail-cargo-reader = Outputs cargo inventory contents to circuit network
rail-cargo-reader2 = Do the same thing as mk1 but reads all train carriages(Cargo only)
rail-mode-controller = Sets train manual mode to selected on signal rising edge (switching from 0 to 1)

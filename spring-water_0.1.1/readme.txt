===Spring Water Mod===

This mod adds a water resource that can be pumped with a pumpjack like oil.
The water that comes out of the pump will be hot water that can be used directly in steam engines or any building that requires water.

The frequency of these springs is low.
The apparent yield of the springs is quite low, but this means that hopefully it won't drop much from its initial value, unlike oil.
Expect 20 units per second at depletion which is not much more than one small pump.
